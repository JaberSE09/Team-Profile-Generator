# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

The Team profile generator creates a HTML file in the dist/ folder for a team. The team has a manager, engineer and intern.

The motivation was to create a simple but powerful command line generated html file.
This project was built to help a team create a html file with there employee information. The problem it solved was creating a interactive website that would display the user input for a team.
I learned the role objects can play through JavaScript and using them to create the basis for the application.
